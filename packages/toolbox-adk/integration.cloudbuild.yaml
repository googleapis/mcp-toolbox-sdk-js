steps:
  # STEP 1: Build the 'core' dependency first
  # This step runs 'npm ci' which WILL install devDependencies
  # (like 'typescript') because it's the top-level package for this step.
  
  
  # STEP 2: Install the 'adk' package
  # This 'npm ci' will now find the pre-built 'build' folder in
  # 'toolbox-core' and won't need to run its 'prepare' script.
